# Simple Interest Calculator

This repository contains a simple **Bash** script that calculates the **simple interest** on a principal amount over a period of time at a given annual rate of interest.

## Overview

The script prompts the user to enter three values:

1. **Principal amount (p)** – the initial amount of money.
2. **Annual rate of interest (r)** – the interest rate per year (as a decimal, e.g. enter `0.05` for 5%).
3. **Time period (t)** – the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.

The calculator then computes the simple interest using the formula:

```
simple interest = p * r * t
```

The result is displayed to the user.

## Usage

Run the script from a terminal:

```
bash simple-interest.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter the principal (`p`), rate (`r`), and time (`t`). The script will then output the calculated simple interest.
